    Daytripper is a chatbot that can learn new knowledge in addition to providing search services
    such as map, video, and Web searches.
    The app utilizes artificial intelligence and natural language processing based on <a
        href="http://alicebot.org">Alicebot</a> chatbot.
    In addition to general chatbot and utility features, you can teach the app new knowledge as
    explained below.
</p>

<div>
    <h1>Map Search</h1>
    <p>
        Daytripper recognizes certain food items such as "pizza" or "taco".
        The app can then display a map of nearby food places.
        Map search is also triggered by questions like "where is X?" or "where are the X?".
    </p>
    <div>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
    <pre>
    Pizza<br/>
    Where is India?<br/>
    Where are the best sushi?<br/>
    </pre>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Web Browsing and Search</h1>
    <p>
        Daytripper recognizes popular sites such as "espn" and automatically displays them on the
        browser.
        You can also input phrases such as "who is X?" or "google Y" to trigger web search, lookup
        information from Wikipedia, play a video, and access other information from the Internet.
    </p>
    <div>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
    <pre>
    jobs nurse<br/>
    who is David Cameron?<br/>
    google french fries<br/>
    tell me a joke<br/>
    play u2<br/>
    </pre>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Learning abilities</h1>
    <p>
        Daytripper can learn new knowledge using a simple learning algorithm.
        You tell it facts and then ask queries based on those facts.
    </p>
    <div>
        <h3>Relations</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Enter a phrase "my uncle is X" such as "my uncle is Bob".</li>
            <li>Now ask "who is my uncle?". Daytripper responds with "Bob."</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Lists</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a list - "make a food list".</li>
            <li>Add one item to the list - "add apple to my food list".</li>
            <li>Add another item to the the list - "add orange to my food list".</li>
            <li>Add one more item to the list - "add bread to my food list".</li>
            <li>Now ask for contents of the list - "read my food list".</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Association</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Input a location that is not in Daytripper's database like "Santorini". The app
                responds with a random
                message.
            </li>
            <li>Tell Daytripper the input in step #1 is a location - "Santorini is a location". The
                location gets added to its database.
            </li>
            <li>Input "Santorini" (the location in step #1) again. This time Daytripper shows a map
                of that location.
            </li>
        </ol>
