####Daytripper is a chatbot and personal assistant that learns new knowledge in addition to providing search services such as map, video, and Web searches. The app utilizes artificial intelligence and natural language processing based on [Alicebot](http://alicebot.org) chatbot. In addition to general chat and utility features, you can teach the app new knowledge as explained below.

##Map Search
Daytripper recognizes certain food items such as "pizza" or "taco". The app can then display a map of nearby food places. Map search is also triggered by questions like "where is X?" or "where are the X?".

###Examples
    Pizza
    Where is India?
    Where are the best sushi?

##Web Browsing and Search
Daytripper recognizes popular sites such as "espn" and automatically displays them on the browser. You can also input phrases such as "who is X?" or "google Y" to trigger web search, lookup information from Wikipedia, play a video, and access other information from the Internet.

###Examples
    jobs nurse
    who is David Cameron?
    google french fries
    tell me a joke
    play u2

##Learning abilities
Daytripper can learn new knowledge using a simple learning algorithm. You tell it facts and then ask queries based on those facts.

###Relations
1. Enter a phrase "my uncle is X" such as "my uncle is Bob".
2. Now ask "who is my uncle?". Daytripper responds with "Bob."

###Lists
1. Create a list - "make a food list".
2. Add one item to the list - "add apple to my food list".
3. Add another item to the the list - "add orange to my food list".
4. Add one more item to the list - "add bread to my food list".
5. Now ask for contents of the list - "read my food list".

###Association
1. Input a location that is not in Daytripper's database like "Santorini". The app responds with a random message.
2. Tell Daytripper the input in step #1 is a location - "Santorini is a location". The location gets added to its database.
3. Input "Santorini" (the location in step #1) again. This time Daytripper shows a map of that location.
