   	  Daytripper is an app for finding places and events.
   	  The app utilizes artificial intelligence and natural language processing to offer some unique features.
   	  <ol>
   	  	<li>
   	  	<b>Contextual display.</b>
   	  	<div>
   	  	The app finds information from several content partners including business listings, events, and meetings.
   	  	You can find restaurants, shopping, gas stations, nightlife, museums, and just about any type of business listing.
   	  	Within the same app, you can find concerts, sporting events, plays, comedy shows, and other ticketed events.
   	  	If you would like to meet some locals the app can find "meetups" on various topics.
   	  	The app can even call a taxi for you if you need a ride to any of these places.
   	  	Fluid display accommodates the broad variety of data.
   	  	Business listings are displayed with star ratings and review counts, events are shown with times, and meetups include membership counts.
   	  	Items with physical locations are shown on a map.
   	  	</div>
   	  	</li>
   	  	<li>
   	  	<b>Natural language understanding.</b>
   	  	<div>
   	  	All those features mentioned above are triggered by typing or speaking phrases.
   	  	The app is driven almost entirely with words, making it ideal for those with little computer proficiency.
   	  	If the device supports voice search, you can simply speak whatever you are looking for.
   	  	The app exploits context and the query's grammar and meaning to extract locations and other concepts.
   	  	</div>
   	  	</li>
   	  	<li>
   	  	<b>Real world effects.</b>
   	  	<div>
   	  	Daytripper is more than a search app.
   	  	With mere words, you can perform tasks of varying complexities.
   	  	At the simplest level, you can enter phrases to enable or disable the app's voice response.
   	  	Slightly more complex is zooming in or out on a map with simple phrases like "zoom to 20".
   	  	As previously mentioned, you can even call a taxi by entering a phrase and making a few screen taps.
   	  	</div>
   	  	</li>
   	  </ol>
   	  Please continue reading below for query details with examples.

         </ul>

         See the following as examples.

            <li>"shops in New York, NY by ratings"</li>
         </ul>
      </div>
      <h3>Filtering</h3>
      <div>
         All queries should be filtered by location.
         If no location is specified then the phone's location is used as default.
         Please use grammatically correct phrases, e.g. enter "restaurants in New York", not "restaurants New York". 
         For best results, please enter city, state or province (if applicable), and country.
         If a country is not entered then country "US" will be used as default.
    	 Yelp queries in US should not include a country (city, 2-letter state code only).	
         For US states, use 2-letter state codes (a list could be found at this link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:US">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:US</a>).
         For Canada provinces, use 2-letter province codes (a list could be found at this link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:CA">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:CA</a>). 
         For countries, try using 2-letter country code first in the query. 
         If no results are found, then try another query using the full country name. 
         A list of country codes could be found at this link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes</a>.
      </div>
      <h4>Similarity Search (Seatgeek Only)</h4>
      <div>
         A Seatgeek search can find singers similar to a particular singer. 
         For this type of search, a postal code must be used as location filter rather than city, state/province, and country.
         If no postal code is specified then the phone's location will be used.
         A couple query examples are shown below.
         <ul>
         	<li>"singers like Taylor Swift in 37115"</li>
         	<li>"singers like Neil Diamond"</li>
         </ul>
      </div>
      <h4>Sorting (Yelp Only)</h4>
      <div>
         Yelp queries may be sorted by Yelp's proprietary ratings, or by distance.
         Results sorted by distance are listed according to proximity with phone's location.
         Please use grammatically correct phrases, e.g. enter "restaurants by distance", not "restaurants distance". 
         A couple examples are shown below.
         <ul>
         	<li>"gas stations by distance"</li>
         	<li>"pubs in London, GB by ratings"</li>
         </ul>
      </div>
      <h3>Special Commands</h3>
      <h4>Ride with Uber</h4>
      <div>Daytripper offers a powerful feature to make Uber ride requests entirely with words.
      There are many ways to start this process. 
      Some phrases are shown below.
      <ol>
      	<li>"drive me" (after tapping on a Map point)</li>
      	<li>"pick up" (after tapping on a Map point)</li>
      	<li>"take me" (after tapping on a Map point)</li>
      	<li>"pick up 1" (Map point tap not required)</li>
      	<li>"pick up from 1455 Market St, San Francisco, CA, 94103" (after tapping on a Map point)</li>
      </ol>
      Phrases 1-3 requires users to first tap on a Map point before inputting the phrase.
      The Map view refreshes to show two points, the pick-up and drop-off locations.
      Pick-up location is set to coordinates of the phone's location.
      Drop-off location is set to coordinates corresponding to point tapped by the user. 
      At the top of Map view are shown reverse geocoded addresses of pick-up and drop-off locations.
      Switching to List view shows a list of Uber products (e.g. UberX, UberXL, UberBlack, and UberSUV).
      Click on a link and the user is taken to Uber's mobile page to complete the ride request.
      Phrase 4 initiates an Uber request by selecting an item in List view and entering "pick up &lt;number&gt;", where &lt;number&gt; is the item's number within the list.
      This powerful method lets users make an Uber request without searching and tapping on Map points.
      Phrase 5 lets a user enter the pick-up address.
      Address components are &lt;street&gt;, &lt;city&gt;, &lt;state&gt;, and &lt;postal code&gt;.
      For proper geocoding, address components should be properly capitalized and separated by commas (e.g. "San Francisco, CA" not "san francisco ca").
      </div>
      <h4>Changing Zoom Levels</h4>
      <div>
      Words may be used to alter zoom levels of the map.
      Simply enter "zoom to  &lt;number&gt;" where &lt;number&gt; typically range from 1-20.
      <ul>
      	<li>"zoom to 20" (zoom in to finest details)</li>
      	<li>"zoom to 1" (zoom out to lowest level)</li>
      </ul> 
      This method is a more convenient way to change zoom levels without clicking zoom controls repeatedly.
      </div>
      <h4>Altering Text-to-Speech Setting</h4>
      Turning on or off the text-to-speech feature may be done by words.
      Enter any of these phrases in the text box to disable text-to-speech.
      <ul>
      	<li>"be quiet"</li>
      	<li>"shut up"</li>
      	<li>"stop talking"</li>
      </ul>
      To enable text-to-speech, enter any of these phrases.
      <ul>
      	<li>"say something"</li>
      	<li>"speak up"</li>
      	<li>"talk to me"</li>		
      </ul>
