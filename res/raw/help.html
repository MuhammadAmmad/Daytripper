         </ul>
      </div>
      <h3>Filtering</h3>
      <div>
         All queries should be filtered by location.
         If no location is specified then the phone's location is used as default.
         Please use grammatically correct phrases, e.g. enter "restaurants in New York", not "restaurants New York". 
         For best results, please enter city, state or province (if applicable), and country.
         If a country is not entered then country "US" will be used as default.
    	 Yelp queries in US should not include a country (city, 2-letter state code only).	
         For US states, use 2-letter state codes (a list could be found at this link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:US">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:US</a>).
         For Canada provinces, use 2-letter province codes (a list could be found at this link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:CA">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:CA</a>). 
         For countries, try using 2-letter country code first in the query. 
         If no results are found, then try another query using the full country name. 
         A list of country codes could be found at this link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes</a>.
      </div>
      <h4>Similarity Search (Seatgeek Only)</h4>
      <div>
         A Seatgeek search can find singers similar to a particular singer. 
         For this type of search, a postal code must be used as location filter rather than city, state/province, and country.
         If no postal code is specified then the phone's location will be used.
         A couple query examples are shown below.
         <ul>
         	<li>"singers like Taylor Swift in 37115"</li>
         	<li>"singers like Neil Diamond"</li>
         </ul>
      </div>
      <h4>Sorting (Yelp Only)</h4>
      <div>
         Yelp queries may be sorted by Yelp's proprietary ratings, or by distance.
         Results sorted by distance are listed according to proximity with phone's location.
         Please use grammatically correct phrases, e.g. enter "restaurants by distance", not "restaurants distance". 
         A couple examples are shown below.
         <ul>
         	<li>"gas stations by distance"</li>
         	<li>"pubs in London, GB by ratings"</li>
         </ul>
      </div>
      <h3>Special Commands</h3>
      <h4>Ride with Uber</h4>
      <div>Daytripper has a powerful feature to make an Uber ride request entirely with words.</div>
      <div>
      There are many ways to start this process. 
      The simplest way is to perform a regular search. 
      Then switch to Map view, tap on a point, and enter any of these phrases.
      <ul>
      	<li>"drive me"</li>
      	<li>"pick up"</li>
      	<li>"take me"</li>
      </ul>
      The Map view is altered to show two points, the pick-up and drop-off locations.
      Pick-up location is set to coordinates closest to the phone's location.
      Drop-off location is set to coordinates corresponding to point tapped by the user. 
      Towards the top of Map view are shown reverse geocoded addresses of pick-up and drop-off locations.
      Now switch to List view and Uber products (e.g. uberX, uberXL, uberBlack, uberSUV) will be shown.
      Click a link and the user is taken to Uber's mobile page to complete the ride request.
      </div>
      <div>
      Another way to initiate an Uber request is to visually select an item in List view, and enter "pick up to &lt;number&gt;" where &lt;number&gt; is the item's number within the list.
      This is a powerful method to make an Uber request without searching and tapping on Map points.
      </div>
      <h4>Changing Zoom Levels</h4>
      <div>
      Words may be used to alter zoom levels of the map.
      Simply enter "zoom to <number>" where <number> typically range from 1-20.
      <ul>
      	<li>"zoom to 20" (zoom in to finest details)</li>
      	<li>"zoom to 1" (zoom out to lowest level)</li>
      </ul> 
      This method is a more convenient method to change zoom levels without clicking zoom controls repeatedly.
      </div>
      <h4>Altering Text-to-Speech Setting</h4>
      Turning on or off the text-to-speech feature may be done by words.
      Enter any of these phrases in the text box to disable text-to-speech.
      <ul>
      	<li>"be quiet"</li>
      	<li>"shut up"</li>
      	<li>"stop talking"</li>
      </ul>
      To enable text-to-speech, enter any of these phrases.
      <ul>
      	<li>"say something"</li>
      	<li>"speak to me"</li>
      	<li>"talk to me"</li>		
      </ul>
